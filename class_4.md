## project 2:

* resource scheduling (resource, person, time)
* ticketing system (issue, person, tags)

## git review

* I have a remote repository on github, but not on my computer

1. check your location with `pwd`, e.g. `cd rails/`
2. clone the remote repo with ssh `git clone git@github.com:/[username]/[repository].git` don't include the brackets. e.g. `git clone git@github.com:yoon/truman_rails_1.git`
or
2. clone the remote repo over http (you'll have to type your username and password every time) `git clone http://github.com/[username]/[repository].git` don't include the brackets. e.g. `git clone http://github.com/yoon/truman_rails_1.git`

* I have a local repository, but not on github

1. make sure you're in the project directory with `pwd`, e.g. `cd rails/project1`
2. add github as a 'remote' `git remote add origin git@github.com/[username]/[project].git` without the brackets, e.g. `git remote add origin git@github.com:yoon/truman_rails_1.git`
3. push your local changes to your empty remote `git push origin master`

* I want to get changes from github

1. make sure you're in the project directory with `pwd`, e.g. `cd rails/project1`
2. pull the changes from 'origin' to your 'master' branch `git pull origin master`

* I want to put my local changes on github

1. make sure you're in the project directory with `pwd`, e.g. `cd rails/project1`
2. push the changes from your 'master' branch to 'origin' `git push origin master`

* I want to resolve a merge conflict

1. see what is different `git status` and `git diff`
2. edit the files, then commit the result `git add [files]` e.g. `git add something.txt`, then `git commit -m "merged changes"`
